 1. Basis Flipflop und Kontroller zu realisieren
 2. VTR noch einzuarbeiten
 3. parallel checkpointing algo zu suchen

 To simulate the behaviour that our processor and flipflop is based on the non-volatile Flipflop to store  
 the state of the processor and to reactivate the system with the stored state -> Nonvolatile_FF.v 

04.03.2022
 The controller of the write and read signals for the non-volatile Flipflop has been already finished.
 for every 400 cycles to generate the write signal for FF and every 500 cycles to generate the read signal 
 for FF.
 
05.03.2022
 The structure of the blif file has been already read through. And have found a library named "libblifparse".
 Tomorrow I wanna try a bit to exchange the subckt from Non-volatile-FF into the blink.blif
